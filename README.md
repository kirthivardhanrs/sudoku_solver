# Backtracking Sudoku Solver

Uses brute force backtracking to solve 9x9 sudokus, inputted from [input.csv](input.csv). I've since learnt that Python may not be the best to implement this particular algorithm since it does not optimize for tail recursion.

Hopefully I find a better Python algorithm or use a different language for tail calls.
